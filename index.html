        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
        named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other
        viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is
        layered with butter, rolled and follded several times in succession,
        then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The
        process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff-pastry.

        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
        crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long
        been a staple of Austrian, Italian and French bakeries and pâtisseries.
        In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed
        but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that can be freshly baked
        by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie
        chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of
        2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries
        were baked from frozen dough. Croissants are a common part of a
        continental breakfast in many European countries.
