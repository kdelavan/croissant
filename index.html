      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with
      butter, rolled and follded several times in succession, then rolled into a
      thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
      layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff-pastry.

      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been
      a staple of Austrian, Italian and French bakeries and pâtisseries. In the
      late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but
      unbaked dough made them into a fast food that can be freshly baked by
      unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain,
      was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40%
      of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
      frozen dough. Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in
      many European countries.
